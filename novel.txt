He didn't know why they were there... but they were.
Lying on the ground, he saw a rag, which, on closer inspection, had the faint scent of chloroform.

“Chloroform?!” he cried. “I hate this stuff! It’s nasty! It’s - “

He passed out.

Sometime later, he awoke, finding himself tied to a bed in a small room.  The door was closed, but he could hear the creaking of floorboards.  The creaking became louder, until he could see a shadow fall across the bottom gap of the doorframe.  The knob began to turn…

“CRAP! That is the LAST TIME I sniff a rag soaked in chloroform! Dumbass! Kiss your kidney goodbye, stupid!”

Teeth clenched, sweat dripping from his forehead, he wasn’t sure what to think. Was he really about to lose a kidney?!

The door opened. And then…

“SURPRISE!!!!!!!!!!!!” A gaggle of friends burst into the room.

“HAPPY BIRTHDAY!”

Shocked, pissed and generally stunned, John spoke up, chastising his dumb friends.

“JESUS CHRIST GUYS! You’re a bunch of sick bastards making me think my organs were going to be harvested for the black market! Dicks!”

Glorious amounts of food were served, copious amounts of alcohol consumed, it was 2am when John passed out again, on the same bed, organs intact.

“I have some weird fucking friends!”
